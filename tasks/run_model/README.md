# Run sklearn model
## Description
This script loads a trained scikit-learn model and runs it on a CSV dataset file to produce predictions. The model is loaded using the `joblib` library, and the dataset is read using the `pandas` library. The predictions are then saved into a new CSV file.

### Example
`trained_model`: sklearn model file

`dataset`:
```csv
Feature1,Feature2,Feature3
1,2,3
4,5,6
7,8,9
```

`preds_csv`:
```csv
predicted
5
6
7
```

## Inputs
- `trained_model` - trained model file (binary)
- `dataset` - CSV data file (structured text)

## Outputs
- `preds_csv` - CSV file with predictions (structured text)

## Parameters
- `delimiter` - column delimiter (default: ',')
