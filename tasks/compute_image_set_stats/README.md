# Compute image set statistics
## Description
This Task computes the mean and standard deviation of a set of images. It iterates through the images in the specified directory, converts each image to a numpy array, normalizes the pixel values, and computes the mean and standard deviation using Welford's algorithm.

## Inputs
- `images` - directory containing the images

## Outputs
- `stats` - a CSV file containing the mean and standard deviation of the images

## Example
Input images:
- `image1.jpg`
- `image2.jpg`
- `image3.jpg`

Output `stats`:
```csv
name,value
mean,[0.467, 0.490, 0.529]
std,[0.237, 0.228, 0.216]
```
