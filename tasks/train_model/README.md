# Train Sklearn model
## Description
This Task trains a scikit-learn model using either a Decision Tree Classifier or a Gradient Boosting Classifier. It reads a CSV file with training data and saves a trained model to a file.

## Inputs
- `train_set` - CSV file containing the training data

## Outputs
- `trained_model` - File containing the trained model

## Parameters
- `y_column` - Column name of the target variable
- `classifier` - Classifier to use (either "DecisionTreeClassifier" or "GradientBoostingClassifier")
- `max_depth` - Maximum depth of the decision tree (only applicable for DecisionTreeClassifier)
- `n_estimators` - Number of boosting stages to perform (only applicable for GradientBoostingClassifier)
- `random_seed` - Seed used to control the randomness of the classifiers
- `delimiter` - Column delimiter in the CSV file (default: ',')
